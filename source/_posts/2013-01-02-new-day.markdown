I recently decided that I no longer wanted to use GIBSY to host my blog. GIBSY
was a fun learning project and I enjoyed working on it last year and over the
summer, but I wanted something a bit more feature rich, and 100% static html. So
I have switched over to using octopress which is based on
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). I am hosting this all out of s3 so
I don't have to deal with uptime problems. The plan is to, instead of importing
all my old posts that are in gibsy, to just store it as a extra page in
octopress. That way all the old posts are still around but without the trouble
of importing them.
